/**
 * <p>A <code>PropertySetIndex</code> re-indexer that uses a temporary index instance, instead of working
 * directly on the target index. This has the advantage that the target index can be searched 
 * while re-indexing is running. When the temporary index is complete, its contents will
 * replace the target index' contents in one go.
 * 
 * <p>The target index will be exclusively locked for writing immediately, while the re-indexing runs
 * on the temporary index. This is done to avoid losing any updates that might happen
 * during the operation. This, however, does not prevent doing queries on the target index.
 * 
 * <p>The provided temporary index will be explicitly closed after usage.
