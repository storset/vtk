/**
 * A service is an abstraction added to the thin web layer in web
 * applications to facilitate two purposes that ordinary web
 * frameworks usually miss:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Instead of mapping requests to controllers by looking at the
 *       URI and the URI only, it lets you map requests based on
 *       anything you like in a hierarchical way. The mechanism is
 *       made flexible by having Assertions evaluated without
 *       arguments, instead relying on relevant contexts to be
 *       supplied by way of e.g. thread local.
 *   <li>In addition to mapping requests, it's also makes it possible
 *       to dynamically construct request URLs to desired services on
 *       any level by looking at the assertions type
 * </ul>
