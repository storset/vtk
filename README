To set up a minimal version of the Vortikal server the following steps
are necessary:

1. Download and install Maven 2
   ( http://maven.apache.org/download.html )

2. Create a database using the DDL in the
   'src/main/sql/postgresql-schema.sql' (currently only PostgreSQL is
   supported, but HSQLDB has also been known to work in the past). The
   current PostgreSQL usage requires the language 'plpgsql' to be
   installed in the database which can be installed with the following
   command 'createlang plpgsql <database>'.

3. Set up the configuration. Configuration should be placed in the
   file ~/.vrtx.properties

  indexStorageRootPath = [an empty directory for storing indices]
  jdbcUsername = [your JDBC user]
  jdbcPassword = [your JDBC password]
  repositoryDataDirectory = [an empty directory for storing files]
  repositoryTrashCanDirectory = [an empty directory for storing "deleted" files]
  repositoryRevisionDirectory = [an empty directory for storing file revisions]
  databaseURL = [your JDBC URL, e.g. jdbc:postgresql:my-user>]
  xslFilePath = [the path to webdocuments]

4. Run the command 'mvn jetty:run' (standing in the project
   directory). 

5. You should now be able to access the web service on
   http:localhost:9322/ and the WebDAV service on
   http://localhost:9321/. Log in as 'root@localhost:fish'.

6. See the default configuration file
   'src/main/resources/vortikal/beans/vortikal.properties' for
   descriptions of the various configuration settings.

7. Custom bean definitions and overriding can be placed in the file
   ~/.vrtx-context.xml (loaded if it exists).

8. Serving static resources from the file system: add an entry to the
   ~/.vrtx-context.xml file:

  <bean class="org.vortikal.web.StaticResourceLocation">
    <property name="uriPrefix" value="/my/uri/prefix" />
    <property name="resourceLocation" value="file:///my/file/path" />
  </bean>
