 * A node (<code>PropertySet</code>) can be a parent of other nodes

 * operations that cannot be mixed with other write operations from other threads
 * at the same time. Any modifying operation will not be visible by
 * other index users/readers before {@link commit()} has been called, as long
 * as the lock has been acquired properly first.
